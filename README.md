# Employee_Management
Employee management web application

1. Developed a single page application(SPA) with MVC framework design based on AngularJS.

2. For the front-end, used HTML, CSS to develop the UI and used Bootstrap to do the responsive design for different mobile platform.

3. Utilized the features of AngularJS to implement the MVC. For the model layer, wrote service functions with http calls to handle the JSON format data. Used route to link different controllers to different views. In the controllers, called functions in the service to pass the data to the front-end view and make the data consistent with two-way data biding feature.

4. For the back-end, built Rest APIs with MySQL queries to handle data transaction with NodeJS/ExpressJS.
